    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    phone VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE,
    email VARCHAR(255),
    timezone VARCHAR(50),
    business_hours JSONB,
    services JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
)

-- Customer Entity  
customers (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    business_id UUID REFERENCES businesses(id),
    name VARCHAR(255),
    phone VARCHAR(20),
    email VARCHAR(255),
    preferences JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(business_id, phone)
)

-- Appointment Entity
appointments (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    business_id UUID REFERENCES businesses(id),
    customer_id UUID REFERENCES customers(id),
    start_time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    end_time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
